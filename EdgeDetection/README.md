The task is to implement a edge detection method, i.e. it is not enough to call a similar MATLAB function.
Detecting connected edges on images. Implementing a robust edge detection method, including proper filtering, edge linking and thinning, for grayscale images. The output is a black-and-white (binary) image with thick, connected edges.
- The script itself is script.m file. As input in line 1 you can put any picture (im1.jpg, im2.jpg, im3.jpg)
- The description is in Edge detection.pdf file
